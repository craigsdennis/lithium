ROADMAP
=======

This file just contains a list of features for future releases that contributors can help work on. Try and create an issue on GitHub and tag it as a 'feature request' to get it on here. Pull requests for the next patch version will generally go into the develop branch, pull requests for the next minor release will go into the minor.next branch, while pull requests for the next major release will go into the major. From here, features for the next patch, minor and major releases are added to the [TODO.md](TODO.md) file, alongside bug fixes that are needed.

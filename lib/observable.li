	# Question: Why Symbol.observable rather than Symbol.observer, given it's 
	# Symbol.iterator and not Symbol.iterable? 

	# Answer: With Observables, data is pushed (you recieve it when it's ready). 
	# With Iterators, on the other hand, data is pulled. Observables take an 
	# observer, and push information to it.

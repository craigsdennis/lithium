# Maps

The Maps package contains all kinds of maps (a collection that *maps* a key to a value). First off is the plain old base [Map](./map.md) class.

```lithium
export Map from 'map.li'
```
Also exported are the [AsyncMap](./async-map.md), [ImmutableMap](./immutable-map.md) and [WeakMap](./weak-map.md) classes.
```lithium
export AsyncMap from 'async-map.li'
export ImmutableMap from 'immutable-map.li'
export WeakMap from 'weak-map.li'
```

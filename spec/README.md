# Specification

This directory contains a draft specification describing how to parse and interpret Lithium code. 

The target audience for this document is language implementors. If you're just writing Lithium code, you're probably looking for the [`docs`](../docs/) directory, which has documentation for language syntax, semantics and the standard library.

As this document is a draft, it is not recomended that you follow this to the letter when creating a Lithium implementation just yet. You are better off using `li.js` as a reference implementation and copying its behaviours.

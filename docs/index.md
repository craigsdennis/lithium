# Lithium Docs

The Lithium documentation is split into seven sections. The sections include a bunch of tutorials, a couple of dozen topical guides, a language reference, a standard library reference, information for package authors and information for language implementors, as well as links to further resources and requently asked questions.

## Contents

* [*Tutorials*](./tutorials/index.md) - Tutorials for beginners or those wanting a quick overview of the language.
* [*Guides*](./guides/index.md) - A collection of reasonably indepth guides to various topics, e.g. web servers, using databases, etc.
* [*Language*](./language/index.md) - Documentation for the language syntax and semantics.
* [*Standard Library*](./stdlib/index.md) - Documentation for all of the packages included in the standard library.
* [*Packages](./packages/index.md) - Documentation for package authors and users.
* [*Compilers and Interpreters*](./implementations/index.md) - Documentation for compiler and interpreter authors. See also: [`spec`](../spec/index.md).
* [*Further Reading*](./futher-reading/index.md) - A yet-to-be-started collection of recommended resources, such as blogs.
* [*What the FAQ?*](./what-the-faq/index.md) - Lots and lots of frequently (or anticipated to be) asked questions, both good and stupid.

## Contributing

Documentation is a never ending pursuit (and it takes a long long time to reach the point of dominishing returns), and so any contributions are greatly appreciated. The [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file is the starting point for anyone wanting to contribute to the Lithium documentation.

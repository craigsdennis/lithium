Variables
========

Variables in Lithium can be declared or values reassigned in three different ways:

```lithium
type variableName
```

This creates a variable with the name `variableName` and the type `type`. The value of the variable will be null.

```lithium
type variableName : value
```

This creates a variable with the name variableName` and the type `type`. The value of the variable will be `value`.

```lithium
variableName : value
```

This assigns the variable `variableName` the value of `value`. The variable must have been declared previously using one of the two statements above.

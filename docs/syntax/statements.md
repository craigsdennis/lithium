Statements
==========

Statements include things like if-else, try-catch, while, until and other code blocks.

Statements are differentiated from functions by having a space between the name of the statement and the expression's first open bracket. For example:

```lithium
if (x=true):      # Space
	console.log("x isn't true")
else
	console.log("x isn't true")
	
randomFunction(x) # No space.
```

Variables
=======

`var` is the base type in Lithium. However, any variable with the `var` datatype becomes an Object as soon as any value is given to it. So, in practice, almost any variable used in Lithium is going to not be of type `var`. And when there is a variable of type `var`, the value is only ever going to be `null`.

A variable can have many names

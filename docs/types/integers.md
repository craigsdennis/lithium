Integers
=======

An Integer is one of the two number types in Lithium, the other being the decimal type.

Lithium's intergers are sort of arbitary precision, with the highest precision integer possible used. On small systems, such as an Arduino, this might only be 32 bits, but it could be 64 or more on other systems.

Integers also inhereit methods and properties from the `obj` type.

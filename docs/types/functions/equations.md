# Equations

An equation is a very specialised function - the entire function may only take a finite number of arguments that are a `Number` type, and can only return a single `Number` type (or a `Set` of numbers, or a `Matrix` of numbers). The entire body of the function must be a single expression.

An equation can be created using the `new Equation()` constructor,  

### `new Equation(array arguments, )`

##### Parameters

##### Returns

The `Equation` constructor returns a new `Equation`.

### `Equation#derivative

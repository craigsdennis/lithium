`if` and `else`
===============

The `if` Statement
------------------

As with most other programming languages, Lithium includes an `if` statement. 

```lithium
int x : 1

if (x = 1)
  # This will run.
  doSomething()

if (x = 2)
  # This won't run.
  doSomethingElse()
```

The `if` statement works by only executing any code that is indented by one more tab character than the if statment, if the if statement is true. 

The `else` Statement
--------------------

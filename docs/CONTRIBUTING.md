# Contributing

### New Authors

If you're a new editor/writer of Lithium documentation, you're more than welcome to add yourself to the AUTHORS.md file found in this directory. You can add your current job, twitter handle, email and personal website as well. 

### Creating Pages

Please file an issue before creating a new page. New pages will generally correlate with a new language feature or addition, and in such cases there is not much of a point in filing a separate issue as the creation of a new page is implied.

### Editing Content

Editing spelling and/or grammar mistakes is strongly encouraged. Pull requests that are nothing more than this will be accepted without much fanfare.

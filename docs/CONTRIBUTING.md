### Creating Pages

Please file an issue before creating a new page. New pages will generally correlate with a new language feature or addition, and in such cases there is not much of a point in filing a separate issue as the creation of a new page is implied.

### Editing Content

Editing spelling and/or grammar mistakes is strongly encouraged. Pull requests that are nothing more than this will be accepted without much fanfare.

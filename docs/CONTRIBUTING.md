# Contributing

Hi! If you've opened this file, you're probably interested in contributing to the Lithium documentation. 

## General

There are sure to be many spelling and grammar mistakes in the docs. If you find some and fix them, please send a pull request. If possible, find and fix as many mistakes as you can in the one pull request. 

Generally these corrections will be non-controversial and merged quickly, but if a change might introduce ambiguity or otherwise cause issues (even if it is more correct than the current text), it may take some time to make sure that this won't be the case.

## Tutorials

Ideally, tutorials should be shortish (30 mins to complete as a maximum) and not too detailed (focus on the 'how to' not the 'how does'). Good tutorials will also cover relatively common tasks for beginners, as well as 

Tutorials don't need to refer to other docs as much as guides do, but 

## Guides

Guides are intended for people who are able to use the language to code, but need some help in understanding hwo to solve certain problems and what 'best practice' might be. Some guides may begin to resemble tutorials, but they should be a lot more descriptive and be more in depth.

Guides should refer to the langauge reference and the standard library reference as often as possible (and reasonable).

## Language Reference

The language reference describes the semantics and syntax of Lithium. Usually, the author(s) of a new language feature should write the intial documentation for it, so in practice writing brand new documentation for this section should be pretty rare.

## Standard Library Reference

The standard library reference describes the properties and methods of the various classes in the Lithium standard library. Some of these classes are available at runtime, but others aren't.`

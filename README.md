About Lithium
-------------

Lithium is sort of like a four-way mash between JavaScript, Python, Ruby and the maths you learnt in high school. Most people should be able to understand it within an hour, assuming they 

The name Lithium comes from, well, the element Lithium. Lithium is the lightest metal, yet powers everything from your laptop to your phone to torches to cars. This is sort of the aim with Lithium - create something which is lightweight and can be used almost anywhere.

Philosophy
----------

The so-called 'design philosophy' behind Lithium is fairly similar to that behind Python, but there are some differences. Drawing from the well known "[The Zen of Python](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)" by Tim Peters, these are some principles in designing the Lithium language:

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> People make mistakes so be accomodating.
> Simple is better than complex is better than complicated.
> Code will be read more than it will be written.
> Good ideas are easily explained, bad ideas aren't.
> Would your grandparents understand it?
> Best practices can be forced.
> Don't write any more than you should.
> Not everyone speaks en_US.
> Can you teach it to a highschool class?
> Don't make people use more features than they need.
> Keep it simple.
> How have other people done it?

We like to think that Lithium follows these ideals. For example, even if you have to learn a few keyboard tricks to imput a character or whatnot, you'll appreciate clarity of the code when you revisit it in 18 months.

Using Lithium
-------------

Lithium can theoretically be used in standalone applications, server-side scripting as well as in client-side scripting. There is a reference implementation of the Lithium spec that transcompiles Lithium to JavaScript.

Roadmap and TODOS
-----------------

Lithium is intended to be a continually evolving language. Anyone (developers using Lithium, contributors to a Lithium implementation or contributors to this spec) is invited to submit feature requests as an issue on Github with the label 'feature request'. Accepted feature requests will make it to the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) file.

The [TODO.md](TODO.md) file has a list of features and bigfixes needed for the next release. If you want to contribute, that's a good place to start.

Versioning
----------

Lithium is released as 'snapshots' that are given a version number based on the scheme of `major.minor.fix`. A major release is one that removes features or radically adds or changes other features. A minor release adds features or deprecates (but doesn't remove) others. A fix release is only for security or bug fixes.

The first version of Lithium is 0.0.0, but version 1.0.0 will be the first version that is ready for production use.
